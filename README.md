# Sentiment-Analysis-on-IMDB-Reviews
The problem discussed in this project is about sentiment analysis (SA) on the movie review data gathered from IMDB website. As the branch of natural language processing (NLP), now SA is widely used in analysis of humans’ responses in the areas such as product feedbacks, which has brought a lot of benefits in business and decision making.

The motivation of this project was to know the process and disciplines used in sentiment analysis on polarity classification and compare the performance of two algorithms—Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression (LR). The input to our classifier is movie review text with positive and negative label. After the data preprocessing and text tokenization, we then used supervised learning with hyperparameter tunning and model optimization to output a predicted classification rate on the test set. The final results of two algorithms was compared in multiple matrices shown in Section 5: Experiments and Results.

The original dataset used in this project is available on: https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/.

In practical model training, I used the dataset with the same text resource but better used for model training. It could be downloaded from here:https://github.com/TheClub4/IMDB_Sentiment_Analysis/blob/master/movie_data.csv.
